# Vividi

> Dedicated to *Sibilla and Lorenzo*, next to get married in November 2025. Your love shines through any snippet of this codebase and the most tender glimpse of my life.

## Vibes for vibing people

Everybody loves to celebrate their most important moments: children's first birthdays, friends' graduations and lifelong couples' weddings are examples of days marking life forever.

Vividi provides an enthusiastic approach to photo sharing during all the major events of our lives, collecting them in a digital album similar to the widespread social networks we use in our everyday life.

This distributed approach collects the different perspectives of all the invited people, building a digital collection of memories belonging to the collectivity.

## Vibes: digital memories

Pictures are collected in a set of what here are called *Vibes*: more than a post, as a single picture is accompanied by a caption describing what the user is feeling in that moment; moreover, a tagging system helps with classifying the Vibes in a metrics decided by the user.
